# 👋 Hi, I’m Nosakhare Atekha Endurance (aka **Zionnite**)

🚀 **Senior Software Engineer | Mobile & Cross‑Platform Specialist**
📍 Nigeria · 🌍 Open to **Remote** roles

I build **production‑ready mobile apps** that scale, ship fast, and solve real‑world problems. With **7+ years of experience**, I live at the intersection of **clean architecture**, **great UX**, and **impact‑driven technology**.

## 🧠 What I Actually Do (Beyond the Buzzwords)

```dart
while(problem.exists) {
  analyze();
  architect();
  build();
  ship();
}
```

* 📱 Craft high‑performance apps with **Flutter** & **React Native**
* 🧩 Design scalable architectures (Firebase‑first, API‑driven)
* 🎯 Turn vague ideas into **revenue‑ready products**
* ⚡ Optimize apps for speed, offline‑first usage & real users

## 🛠 Tech Stack I’m Dangerous With

**Mobile & Frontend**
Flutter · Dart · React Native · React · JavaScript · TypeScript

**Backend & Cloud**
Firebase · REST APIs · Node.js (integration‑focused)

**Web & CMS**
WordPress · SEO · Performance Optimization

**Tools & Workflow**
Git · GitHub · CI/CD · Agile · Clean Architecture

## 🧪 Products & Platforms I’m Building

* 🙏 **Prayer Buddy** – A Christian social platform pairing users with weekly prayer partners
* 👗 **Zee Fashion** – Empowering African tailors & shoemakers through digital commerce
* 🚚 **xApp Messenger** – Uber‑style errand & delivery platform with live tracking
* 🧹 **Neatify** – Connecting verified university students to paid cleaning jobs
* 📖 **Offline Bible App** – Fast, lightweight, and fully offline‑first

I don’t just code projects — I **ship ecosystems**.

## 🎓 Teaching & Mentorship

I also train beginners and aspiring developers:

* 🧑🏽‍🏫 8‑week **Web & SEO bootcamp** (HTML, CSS, JS, WordPress)
* 📚 Coding & Mobile Development tutoring (Superprof)

> Teaching sharpens my engineering — and keeps my fundamentals lethal.

## 💡 What Makes Me Different

* ✅ Product‑minded engineer (not just feature‑driven)
* ✅ Strong communication & documentation
* ✅ Experience working with **startups, agencies & founders**
* ✅ Passionate about **impact, faith‑driven tech & scalability**

Hiring me means getting someone who **thinks like an owner**.
